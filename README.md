### How do I get set up? ###

* In each project you have to download all the files and you will have to follow the instructions from the link i have for every project
* Code written in Python 2
* If you are in Linux you don't have to do anything because Python is preinstalled,in Mac and Windows you have to download Python from here(https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it
* To secure that Python is installed correctly run the command "python".If you get an answer like("Python is not recognised...)it means something went wrong with the installation.
